# Climate Risk and Disaster Management

## Week 1 Project
- Imported dataset
- Performed initial data exploration (`info()`, `describe()`, `isnull().sum()`)
- Checked for missing values

## Files
- Week 1 Project.ipynb → Jupyter Notebook with code
- earthquake.csv → Dataset used

# Week 2 Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes earthquake data using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data transformation, feature selection, and machine learning modeling.  
The target variable is **magnitude**, and the goal is to predict earthquake magnitude using available features.

## Steps Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
- Feature transformation and encoding  
- Feature selection using correlation analysis  
- Model training with cross-validation  

## Results
- **Cross-Validation R² Score (mean):** 0.76  
- Fold-wise R² Scores: [0.65, 0.65, 0.70, 0.86, 0.94]  

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository  
2. Install dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)  
3. Open `Week2_Project.ipynb` and run all cells  

## Dataset
Dataset: `earthquake.csv` (Earthquake data for climate risk & disaster management)
