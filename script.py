WEEK 3 COMPLETION CHECKLIST FOR CLIMATE RISK & DISASTER MANAGEMENT
================================================================

PHASE 1: PROJECT SETUP AND ORGANIZATION
---------------------------------------
□ Download your Week 2 project files from Google Colab
  - Go to File → Download → Download .ipynb
  - Save as "Week2_Project.ipynb"

□ Create a local project folder with the following structure:
  Climate-Risk-and-Disaster-Management/
  ├── Week2_Project.ipynb         (Your existing notebook)
  ├── earthquake.csv              (Your dataset)
  ├── app.py                      (New deployment script)
  ├── requirements.txt            (Dependencies)
  ├── model.pkl                   (Saved model file)
  └── README.md                   (Project documentation)

□ Install VS Code if not already installed
□ Open the project folder in VS Code

PHASE 2: MODEL DEPLOYMENT PREPARATION
------------------------------------
□ Save your trained model as a pickle file
  - Add this code to your Week 2 notebook:
    ```python
    import pickle
    # Assuming your model is named 'model'
    with open('model.pkl', 'wb') as f:
        pickle.dump(model, f)
    ```

□ Test your saved model
  - Load and verify it works correctly
  - Document model performance metrics

□ Verify your dataset features and structure
  - Check column names and data types
  - Ensure compatibility with the app.py script

PHASE 3: STREAMLIT APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT
------------------------------------------
□ Copy the provided app.py template to your project folder
□ Customize the app.py based on your specific model:
  - Update input fields to match your dataset features
  - Modify the prediction logic for your trained model
  - Adjust visualizations based on your EDA findings

□ Test the Streamlit application locally:
  - Open terminal in VS Code
  - Run: streamlit run app.py
  - Verify all pages work correctly
  - Test prediction functionality

□ Debug and fix any issues:
  - Check file paths and imports
  - Verify model loading and prediction
  - Ensure all visualizations render properly

PHASE 4: GITHUB REPOSITORY UPDATE
---------------------------------
□ Update your GitHub repository with all new files:
  - Push app.py
  - Push requirements.txt
  - Push model.pkl (if size allows)
  - Push updated README.md
  - Ensure Week 2 notebook is included

□ Test repository structure:
  - Clone to a new location and verify everything works
  - Check that all files are properly uploaded

□ Make repository private until after evaluation

PHASE 5: PRESENTATION PREPARATION
---------------------------------
□ Download the official AICTE presentation template
□ Create presentation following the structure:
  1. Title slide with your details
  2. Problem statement and objectives
  3. Dataset overview and preprocessing
  4. Methodology and model selection
  5. EDA findings and insights
  6. Model development and training
  7. Results and performance metrics
  8. Deployment and web application
  9. Risk assessment framework
  10. Challenges and solutions
  11. Future scope and improvements
  12. Conclusion and key learnings
  13. GitHub repository link
  14. Thank you and Q&A

□ Include specific metrics from your project:
  - Cross-validation R² score: 0.76
  - Fold-wise scores: [0.65, 0.65, 0.70, 0.86, 0.94]
  - Model accuracy and error metrics

□ Add screenshots of your Streamlit application
□ Include data visualizations and plots from your analysis

PHASE 6: FINAL TESTING AND SUBMISSION
-------------------------------------
□ Final test of complete workflow:
  - Download files from GitHub to a new folder
  - Install requirements: pip install -r requirements.txt
  - Run Streamlit app: streamlit run app.py
  - Verify all functionality works

□ Prepare submission materials:
  - PowerPoint presentation file (.pptx)
  - Source code (Week2_Project.ipynb)
  - Ensure GitHub link is included in presentation

□ Submit through AICTE LMS:
  - Upload presentation to designated PPT box
  - Upload source code to designated source code box
  - Do NOT upload presentation to GitHub

PHASE 7: FINAL VERIFICATION
---------------------------
□ Double-check all requirements from mentoring session:
  - Template not modified (colors, themes, logos intact)
  - Complete name and IDs included
  - GitHub repository link in presentation only
  - All files properly organized

□ Backup everything:
  - Local copy of all files
  - GitHub repository updated
  - Presentation saved in multiple formats

TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS
-------------------
- If model.pkl is too large for GitHub, use Git LFS or create a smaller model
- If Streamlit app doesn't work, check file paths and imports
- If deployment fails, verify all dependencies in requirements.txt
- Test with different input values to ensure robustness

DEPLOYMENT COMMANDS
------------------
1. Navigate to project folder: cd path/to/your/project
2. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run Streamlit app: streamlit run app.py
4. Access at: http://localhost:8501

SUCCESS CRITERIA
----------------
✓ Functional Streamlit web application
✓ Complete GitHub repository with all files
✓ Professional presentation following template
✓ Successful local deployment demonstration
✓ All submission requirements met

HELPFUL CODE SNIPPETS FOR WEEK 3 COMPLETION
===========================================

1. SAVE YOUR MODEL (Add to your Week 2 notebook):
```python
import pickle
import joblib

# Method 1: Using pickle
with open('model.pkl', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(your_model, f)

# Method 2: Using joblib (alternative)
joblib.dump(your_model, 'model.joblib')
```

2. LOAD AND TEST MODEL:
```python
# Load the model
with open('model.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    loaded_model = pickle.load(f)

# Test prediction
test_prediction = loaded_model.predict([[test_input]])
print(f"Test prediction: {test_prediction}")
```

3. CREATE MODEL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:
```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score, mean_absolute_error

# Calculate metrics
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)
mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred)
rmse = np.sqrt(mse)

print(f"Model Performance:")
print(f"R² Score: {r2:.4f}")
print(f"MSE: {mse:.4f}")
print(f"MAE: {mae:.4f}")
print(f"RMSE: {rmse:.4f}")
```

4. UPDATE README.MD:
```markdown
